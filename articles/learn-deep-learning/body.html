<p>
The book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" written by Michael Nielsen locate at: <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com">http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com</a>
</p>

<p>
I read a lot of papers and books about machine learning, most of them are quite heavily into mathematics, except this one. 
<br>
It's not without mathematics, on the contrary, it taught me a lot of mathematical knowledge.
<br>
I like the writing style of this book, while now I have finished reading this book, donate a bit to the author.
Hope he can keep writing :D
