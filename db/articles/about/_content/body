<p>I have writen a blog software based on GAE(Google App Engine) three years ago(Jan 2013),
after that, GAE update frequently, and cannot be accessed from mainland China,
so, I decided to write this new one. the old one's backup link: <a href="http://duke-blog.appspot.com">http://duke-blog.appspot.com</a></p>

<p>Features of this new one:<br/>
RESTful: backend and frontend are separated, exchange data through API interface;<br/>
Server side application writen by bash script, all data are stored by structed folders and files(not the traditional databases);<br/>
Browser side application build on Angular2, it's a SPA(Single Page Applacation);<br/>
Articles are supported in different formats, support html and plain text currently;<br/>
Article list can be procedured by any filter, no amount and type limit;<br/>
Sub-comment are supported;<br/>
Comment policy have multiple types: anonymous without verification, captcha verification or email verification.</p>

<p>Features remained from old one:<br/>
Permission management for articles.</p>

<p>Known disadvantages:<br/>
Most search engine not support pages which rendered by javascript(except Google Search);<br/>
HTML5 mode url is poor compatibility.</p>
