I have writen a blog software based on GAE(Google App Engine) three years ago(Jan 2013),
after that, GAE update frequently, and cannot be accessed from mainland China,
so, I decided to write this new one. the old one's backup link: http://duke-blog.appspot.com

Features of this new one:
RESTful: backend and frontend are separated, exchange data through API interface;
Server side application writen by bash script, all data are stored by structed folders and files(not the traditional databases);
Browser side application build on Angular2, it's a SPA(Single Page Applacation);
Articles are supported in different formats, support html and plain text currently;
Article list can be procedured by any filter, no amount and type limit;
Sub-comment are supported;
Comment policy have multiple types: anonymous without verification, captcha verification or email verification.

Features remained from old one:
Permission management for articles.

Known disadvantages:
Most search engine not support pages which rendered by javascript(except Google Search);
HTML5 mode url is poor compatibility.

The blog's source code will be released after I finish it.
