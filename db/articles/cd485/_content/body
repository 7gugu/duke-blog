<p>CD485 is a communication protocol based on RS485, but it also represents the hardware implementations.</p>
<p>CD485 protocol was designed by Duke Fong in 2009 for simple, multi-master and high-speed communi-
cation in mind.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>Currently hardware implements:<br/>
• Support multiple master on CD485 bus, arbitration by node ID address<br/>
• Pack user data up to 253 bytes per packet for communication<br/>
• 8 buffer pages for RX purpose, 2 buffer pages for TX purpose, each page is 256 bytes<br/>
• 16 bit hardware CRC generation and verification<br/>
• Baud rate from 103 bps to 9 Mbps (support 10 Mbps by replace the oscillator; and there is another module which support 103 bps to 36Mbps)<br/>
• Separate baud rate setting for arbitration byte and follow data<br/>
• Backward-compatible with traditional RS485 bus<br/>
• Support SPI and I2C peripheral interface<br/>
• Easy configuration and operation
